# JISP
Jisp is LISP using javascript as a host platform, with ability 
to be compiled to javascript as well.

## Why if there is ClojureScript?
ClojureScript is a great language but it has several issues
* Java oriented. It is required to use java and its eco-system to propertly use 
  ClojureScript
* Macros are run in the java environment
* As with usual Clojure - terrible error messages
* ClojureScript data types are not the javascript data types
* No deep and direct interop with the host platform (it's a compiled language, not
  hosted one)
* Edu purposes
